# Solution Description

Task 2.1: Implemented 1D Perlin noise by looking up gradients in hash table at neighboring grid points, evaluating their contributions, and interpolating smoothly using a blending polynomial.

Task 3.1: Implemented 1D fBm by summing multiple octaves of Perlin noise at increasing frequencies and decreasing amplitudes to create layered, natural-looking noise.
