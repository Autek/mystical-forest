# Solution Description

TODO: add a brief description (approximately 10 to 20 lines) of how you solved the proposed exercises

GL2.3: To solve this task, we first computed the position and normal vectors using the model-view and normals-to-view matrices. Then we computed the light and view directions, with the view direction pointing towards the camera. Then we obtained the ambiant, diffuse and specular components as usual and used them to get the color. That color is passed to the fragment shader via the `varying` keyword.
